# Traffic Signal Recognition

#### For this era of the technologically advanced, develop of the autonomous vehicles is the possible significant transportation in the future. Autonomous vehicles when driving on the road need to detect the location of traffic signs and identify the current traffic signs and determine the direction or speed of travel. I want to made this traffic sign recognition system to front let camera of vehicle detect traffic signs and study how the system can be applied to autonomous vehicles.

### System structure and Experiment
> Classify of traffic signal
>> Download photo for 42 types of traffic signal from Kaggle but only choose 23 types of traffic singal from Taiwan usually used that it totally have 15,120 pcs photo. 
>>> Use the VGG16 Model to train my model

> Display accuracy of VGG16 Model
>> Accuracy: 98.41%
>>> Training time: 4H 8M
>>>> Epochs: Estimated trianing of 200 epochs but model traing in NO.22 epoch have best accuracy
