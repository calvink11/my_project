# Traffic Signal Recognition

#### For this era of the technologically advanced, develop of the autonomous vehicles is the possible significant transportation in the future. Autonomous vehicles when driving on the road need to detect the location of traffic signs and identify the current traffic signs and determine the direction or speed of travel. I want to made this traffic sign recognition system to front let camera of vehicle detect traffic signs and study how the system can be applied to autonomous vehicles.

### Technologies and Tools
1. Object Detection
2. Yolov 5
3. CNN Model
